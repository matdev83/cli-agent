------------------------------
Your package does not have name data!
Your package does not have version data!
The version number should be a string.
The package's version number does not comply with PEP-386 or PEP-440.
The package had no description!
The package's long_description is quite short.
Your package does not have classifiers data.
The classifiers should specify what Python versions you support.
You should specify what Python versions you support with the 'requires-python'/'python_requires' metadata.
Your package does not have keywords data.
Your package does not have author data.
Your package does not have author_email data.
Your package should have a 'url' field with a link to the project home page, or a 'project_urls' field, with a dictionary of links, or both.
Your package does neither have a license field nor any license classifiers.
Specifying a development status in the classifiers gives users a hint of how stable your software is.
Your Cheese may have spoiled!! The only way to gather metadata from your package was to execute a patched setup.py. This indicates that your package is using very old packaging techniques, (or that your setup.py isn't executable at all), and Pyroma will soon regard that as a complete failure!
Please modernize your packaging! If it is already modern, this is a bug.
